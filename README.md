# Timeline-App

This is the Task-1 in building a timeline app.

The project includes:

1. A header with logo and theme toggle switch (light/dark).
2. A nav or container for filters/placeholders (empty for now).  
3. A timeline section where event markers will live.
4. A modal area ready for future pop-ups.
5. semantic HTML tags.
