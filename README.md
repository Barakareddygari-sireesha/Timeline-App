# Timeline-App

This is the Task-4 in building a timeline app.

1. Introduced static typing and modular code.
2. Initialized TypeScript. Created tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled.
3. Converted script.js â†’ src/index.ts.
    1. Defined interfaces/types in types.ts for event data.
    2. Used ES modules: (fetcher.ts ,renderer.ts , modal.ts ,index.ts )
4. Added build scripts to compile TypeScript (tsc) into a dist/ folder.
5. Verified the app works in browser using the compiled JavaScript.
